        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is Steven Zhang. I am currently in my second-year at SFU, studying Computing Science. 
            Though I find the inner workings of computers to be fascinating, my time at SFU is only a stepping-stone 
            in my career as a military pilot in the Royal Canadian Air force. Having undergone a year-long screening and selection process
            during grade 12, I was selected shortly after graduating high school in July of 2023. The Canadian Armed Forces currently 
            subsidizes my university education as part of its pipeline to train its pilots - and most of its officers for that matter.
