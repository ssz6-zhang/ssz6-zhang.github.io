                    My name is Steven Zhang. I am currently in my second-year at SFU, studying Computing Science. 
                    Though I find the inner workings of computers to be fascinating, my time at SFU is only a stepping stone 
                    in my career as a military pilot in the Royal Canadian Air force. Having undergone a year-long screening and selection process
                    during grade 12, I was selected shortly after graduating high school in July of 2023. The Canadian Armed Forces currently 
                    subsidizes my university education as part of its pipeline to train its pilots - and most of its officers for that matter.

                <h2>My military career (so far)</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>"How do you attend SFU if you're in the military?"</h3>
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/portrait-farnham.JPG" alt="Portrait taken during Ex. Normandy, Basic Military Officer Qualification" title="Portrait taken during Ex. Normandy, Basic Military Officer Qualification" style="width:600px;height:780px">

                    Though I am a full-time member of the Canadian Armed Forces, I live a civilian life during the school year. I still get paid and receive benefits as any military 
                    member would, and I am still held to the same standards common to all members of the CAF. Upon graduation and receiving my commission, I will be posted to one of
                    the many military bases across Canada for my flight training (likely in Manitoba). Until then, military training only occurs in the summer.

                <h3>Basic Military Officer Qualification (BMOQ)</h3>
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/A-18-farnham.JPG" alt="My platoon during Ex. Normandy" title="My platoon during Ex. Normandy" style="width:600px;height:480px">

                    I did my BMOQ during the summer of 2024 in Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, Quebec. In many ways, it was as one would imagine it to be: early mornings (days start at 0500),
                    long, physical days, lots of push-ups, lots of running, a LOT of yelling, a LOT of swearing, and a LOT of sweating. The Canadian Military is known among its allies as being
                    small but highly professional, and the training reflects that; the instructors genuinely wished to see us succeed, and applying stress through yelling and physical punishment, 
                    among other things, is what they were trained to do. Moreover, they were very nice people who were always willing to help, and often very funny and creative with their verbal "incentives".
                    An experience such as BMOQ builds camaraderie like no other. For 12 weeks, I was laughing, sweating, suffering, and hurting with the same group of fine people.

                    Since I was a child, all I wanted to do was fly airplanes. It was in grade 10 when I learned of the military as a career path and almost immediately set my sights toward this goal.
                    Though I do enjoy studying computer science, I see every day I spend at SFU as one step closer to sitting in the cockpit.

                    My coding experience is limited to assignments from classes taken at SFU. Being that I will not be working with computers in my career, I have not taken much interest in independent coding projects of my own.
                    My favourite languages so far are C and C++, for no particular reason other than they are what I am most familiar with from assignments I have done in other courses. Though I had no coding experience prior to 
                    attending SFU, I quickly found coding to be a very satisfying activity.

                    In terms of CMPT courses I have taken so far, those include 120, 125, 225, and I am currently taking 295 as well as this one, 276. Of these courses, more than half were conducted using C/C++.

                    In January of 2022, we brought home our first ever dog. It was a husky puppy and we decided to name him Maple. In the three years we've had Maple, it has been an absolute joy watching him go
                    from having potty accidents in the house and running away every week for up to 45 minutes at a time, to a loving, loyal, and obedient (for the most part, he's still a husky after all) dog.
                    One of my favourite parts of the day is coming home from school to see him jumping on me at the door and sticking his butt out for me to rub. Taking Maple out to the dog park or on a bike ride is 
                    one of my favourite activities not only because it allows me some fresh air after being indoors at school all day, but being able to witness how fast and powerful huskies are is truly incredible.

                    My first car was a 2002 Acura EL. I bought it when I was 17 using the money I had saved up working at a grocery store. Almost immediately after buying it, I was interested in modifying it, specifically the 
                    exhaust. After a botched muffler job by some guy from Facebook Marketplace, I decided to buy a welder and a jack to learn how to modify my own exhaust. I eventually turned it into a business, fabricating custom 
                    exhaust for ~12 cars during the three months I was doing it. To this day I still work on cars, but the work is mostly oil changes for all the cars in my household.

                    Grade 11 was when I first became interested in motorcycles. I bought my first bike in April 2024; it was a 2011 Kawasaki Ninja 250R with beautiful blue fairings. In September of the same year,
                    I traded it up for a 2005 Kawasaki ZX6R with lava-red fairings and a carbon tail; a larger, faster, and more aggressive bike overall. During the warmer months, I often take the bike to school and out on joyrides with my friends. Just as 
                    I enjoy doing work on my cars, I find working on my bike to be a good time, especially with friends.

                    I first started playing guitar in grade 4. After a year of playing and building some foundational skills, I lost interest completely until Grade 9, and again from grade 10 until may first semester 
                    at SFU. It was actually my girlfriend who convinced me to get back into playing, even buying me an electric guitar for my birthday. These days I mostly enjoy playing solos from various Rock bands, namely Pink Floyd.

                <br>
                <h3>Aviation</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are 4 phases of flight training for RCAF pilots (5 if you're becoming a fighter pilot). Phase 1 takes place in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, on the Grob G 120. Phase 2 takes place in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan,
                    and students fly the CT-156 Harvard II. In some cases, students who are certain they do not want to fly fighter jets in their career can continue in Portage la Prairie on the Grob G 120 during Phase 2. It is at the end of Phase 2
                    where students will be streamed into one of the three aircraft types: helicopters, multi-engine, or jets; from here, training varies depending on the stream.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I would happy with any of the three streams, though I do have my preferences for particular aircraft. I have attached links below for the types of aircraft I would like to fly in my career, by aircraft type.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Helicopters</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Currently, this is the stream I am most interested in, specifically Tactical Helicopters (Tac Hel). What drew me to Tac Hel was the nature of its mission set, which is to provide support to the Army. Canada flies two different helicopters in the tactical 
                    role: the CH-146 Griffon, which is my most desired aircraft currently, and the CH-147 Chinook, one of my least desired (ironically). At the core of Tac Hel is going low and fast to support troops on the ground which is what drew me to this community.

                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Multi-engine</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In my eyes, this route is the safest yet least exciting, in the sense that large fixed-wing aircraft are the least maneuverable and usually do not fly at low altitudes, making it safer compared to helicopters and fighters; yet because they fly long missions, the flights are usually less exciting.
                    Being experienced with multi-engine platforms would also provide me the necessary skillset to work in the commercial aviation industry if I were to pursue that route. There are three multi-engine platforms I would like to fly: the CC-130H/J Hercules (tactical airlift, air-to-air refueling, or search and rescue),
                    the yet to be delivered CC-295 Kingfisher (search and rescue), and the yet to be delivered P-8A Poseidon (maritime patrol and reconnaissance).

                <br>
                <h4>Jets</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Though the idea of becoming a fighter pilot is cool and is what initially drew me to becoming an RCAF pilot, the desire has subsided over the years. Still, I am open to the idea, though it is unlikely to happen unless I regain my former interest, as fighter pilot training is extremely difficult.
                    That's not to say the other streams are easy, because they certainly aren't. Canada currently flies the CF-18 Hornet, but will be replacing them with the F-35 within the next decade.
