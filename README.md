Choice of license: MIT<br>
Reasoning: The MIT license is extremely permissive and allows users the right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish, and sell associated files. Since this is only a personal website and I do not intend on gaining monetary profit, this license was perfect. It is also what was recommended by instructor Rajabi.
